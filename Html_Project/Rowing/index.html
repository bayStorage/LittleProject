        Para Preliminary Races
        Today’s racing began with preliminary races for four of the para boat classes. With fewer than six entries, all
        crews will progress to their finals and it is an opportunity to test their speed and see how they compare to
        their opposition . The PR2 men’s and women’s single sculls were both won by the reigning world champions, Corne
        De Konning of the Netherlands and Kathryn Ross of Australia. The PR3 men’s pair saw a convincing win for Great
        Britain’s Oliver Stanhope and Edward Fuller, who would go on to race in the mixed four later in the session.
        Finally, the PR3 mixed double was a win for Brazilians Diana Cristina Barcelos De Oliveira and Valdeni Da Silva
        Junior.
